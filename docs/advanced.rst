Advanced Usage
==============

Version-controlling with South
------------------------------

By default, Historical models live in the same app as the model they track.
Historical models are tracked by South in the same way as any other model.
Whenever the original model changes, the historical model will change also.

Therefore tracking historical models with South should work automatically.


History for Third-Party Model
-----------------------------

To track history for a model you didn't create, use the
``simple_history.register`` utility.  You can use this to track models from
third-party apps you don't have control over.  Here's an example of using
``simple_history.register`` to history-track the ``User`` model from the
``django.contrib.auth`` app:

.. code-block:: python

    from simple_history import register
    from django.contrib.auth.models import User

    register(User)


Recording Which User Changed a Model
------------------------------------

To denote which user changed a model, assign a ``_history_user`` attribute on
your model.

For example if you have a ``changed_by`` field on your model that records which
user last changed the model, you could create a ``_history_user`` property
referencing the ``changed_by`` field:

.. code-block:: python

    from django.db import models
    from simple_history.models import HistoricalRecords

    class Poll(models.Model):
        question = models.CharField(max_length=200)
        pub_date = models.DateTimeField('date published')
        changed_by = models.ForeignKey('auth.User')
        history = HistoricalRecords()

        @property
        def _history_user(self):
            return self.changed_by
